Hello, guys!

To START a new UTM just: 
 - install docker-ce
 - run "1_start_utm.sh"

To watch whats going on there:
 - "docker logs utm -f"
 - or "docker exec -it utm sh"
   and run "supervisorctl"

  In main window you will see status of services. There you can 
  watch each log file
  by command "tail utm" or "tail updater" for ex.

To DELETE a container:
 - run "2_delete_utm.sh"


When a new version of docker image released in some cases we need
to pull manually a new image by command:
 - "docker pull gmska2011/utm-neo-docker:latest"

In Muxa we trust...
